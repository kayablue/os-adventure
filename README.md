Me learning x86_64 assembly but I have no operating system. I have no actual goal for this project to be something useful, so it exists solely for self-studying purposes. Feel free to use this code to learn something or for, well, whatever

To compile and run this you'd need to have nasm and qemu installed (or someone might try to run this on actual hardware but I severely doubt it would work)
