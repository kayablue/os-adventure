Me learning x86_64 assembly but I have no operating system. I have no actual goal for this project to be something useful, so it exists solely for self-studying purposes. Feel free to use this code to learn something or for, well, whatever. Also, it is not going to be updated frequently due to university studies taking all of the time.

To compile and run this you'd need to have nasm and qemu installed (or someone might try to run this on actual hardware but I severely doubt it would work)
